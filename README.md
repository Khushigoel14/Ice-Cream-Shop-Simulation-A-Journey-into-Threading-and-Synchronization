# üç¶ Ice Cream Shop Simulation: A Journey into Threading and Synchronization

Welcome to the **Ice Cream Shop Simulation**, a project designed to take you into the heart of threading, synchronization, and resource management using the C programming language. This simulation isn't just about scooping ice cream; it's about showcasing how multiple customers interact in a shared environment, accessing resources like flavors, toppings, and tickets in real-time without conflicts. Dive into this experience to learn the intricacies of process synchronization and how to prevent race conditions in a multi-user environment.

## üß† **Why This Project Matters**

In today‚Äôs world, where multiple users interact with shared systems simultaneously, understanding process synchronization is crucial. This project simulates a real-world scenario where multiple customers (threads) access shared resources in an ice cream shop. By implementing concepts like threading, semaphores, and real-time feedback, this simulation offers a practical demonstration of how to manage shared resources efficiently, ensuring a seamless experience without conflicts.

## üéØ **Project Objectives**

### Threading Implementation
- Employ **POSIX threads** to simulate each customer as an individual thread, creating a bustling ice cream shop environment where multiple customers interact concurrently.

### Resource Management
- Utilize **semaphores** to manage shared resources such as tickets, flavors, toppings, and the shop‚Äôs revenue, ensuring fair and regulated access among all customers.

### Race Condition Avoidance
- Implement robust synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions, ensuring multiple customers can access resources like flavors and toppings without conflicts.

### Real-time Feedback Integration
- Incorporate **system calls** for real-time feedback, providing immediate updates on customer actions like ticket acquisition, flavor selection, billing, and departure.

### Educational Demonstration
- Serve as an educational tool that illustrates the importance of process synchronization in multi-user environments, helping users understand the role of synchronization techniques in resource management.

### Practical Application Scenario
- Demonstrate real-world applications by replicating an ice cream shop scenario, showing how synchronization ensures conflict-free and fair resource allocation.

### Accuracy and Realism
- Create an immersive and realistic simulation, accurately replicating an actual ice cream shop environment to enhance understanding of synchronization concepts.

### Educational Value
- Provide an in-depth understanding of threading and synchronization, offering insights into managing shared resources and preventing race conditions in a dynamic, multi-user environment.

## üîç **Simulation Example**

### How It Works

1. **Multithreading Setup**: The simulation uses **POSIX threads** (`pthread.h`) to represent each customer as a thread. This allows multiple customers to interact concurrently, reflecting a busy ice cream shop environment.
2. **Resource Management**: Semaphores (`semaphore.h`) regulate access to shared resources such as tickets, flavors, toppings, and revenue.
3. **Avoidance of Race Conditions**: Synchronization mechanisms are used to prevent conflicts when multiple customers vie for the same resource.
4. **Real-time Feedback**: System calls (`syscall.h`) provide real-time feedback for every action a customer takes, such as selecting flavors, choosing toppings, and completing the transaction.

### Example Steps

**Step 1: Customers Enter the Shop**
- Each customer thread begins by acquiring a ticket.

**Step 2: Flavor and Topping Selection**
- Customers select their preferred flavors and toppings.

**Step 3: Billing and Checkout**
- Customers complete the transaction, and revenue is updated in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Methodology and Implementation**

### Overview of Implementation:
1. **Multithreading Setup**: Utilizes POSIX threads to simulate multiple customers in the shop.
2. **Resource Management**: Semaphores regulate access to resources such as tickets, flavors, and toppings.
3. **Avoidance of Race Conditions**: Prevents conflicts using local thread variables.
4. **Customer Interaction**: Threads represent customers acquiring tickets, selecting flavors, and completing transactions.
5. **Real-time Feedback**: Uses system calls to provide real-time customer actions.
6. **Business Metrics**: Tracks overall revenue and remaining tickets as customers complete transactions.
7. **Cleanup and Exit**: Properly terminates threads and releases semaphores when the shop closes.
